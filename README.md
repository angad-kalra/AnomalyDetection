### AnomalyDetection
A lot of work has been done in the field of anomaly detection especially in the field of cyber security and medical diagnosis. But, due to the ever-increasing threats to human health and network systems, it
is difficult to identify these. </br>
As a part of comparative analysis, I have implemented a number of algorithms on each dataset so as to come up with some modifications in parameters
and conditions in order to optimize the classification model.</br>
I implemented the work done in the following paper to enhance the performance of One-class Support Vector Machine on the datasets.</br>
The datasets used in this project are KDD Unsupervised dataset (network intrusion detection) and Breast cancer
dataset (Breast cancer diagnostics).</br>
# Data preprocessing and feature extraction
• Uniformation of data -</bt>
The instances consist of various data types of feature values which might pose a problem where our algorithms will
need to work with numeric values for mathematical equations. Therefore, the initial step of pre-processing data is to
convert all the feature values into uniform type. Textual characters and alphanumeric values are converted into
numeric values for data uniformity for mathematical calculations.</br>
• Normalization of data -</br>
The next step in pre-processing data is normalization of instances in order to avoid larger computational costs and
scale the values in order to achieve efficient weights and values.
