### AnomalyDetection
A lot of work has been done in the field of anomaly detection especially in the field of cyber security and medical diagnosis. But, due to the ever-increasing threats to human health and network systems, it
is difficult to identify these. </br>
As a part of comparative analysis, I have implemented a number of algorithms on each dataset so as to come up with some modifications in parameters
and conditions in order to optimize the classification model.</br>
I implemented the work done in the following paper to enhance the performance of One-class Support Vector Machine on the datasets.</br>
The datasets used in this project are KDD Unsupervised dataset (network intrusion detection) and Breast cancer
dataset (Breast cancer diagnostics).
